DESCRIPTION:
The social media web application is a platform that allows users to create and share content with other users in a social network. The application is designed to be accessible from desktop and mobile devices, and features a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate and interact with the platform.

The application includes features such as user authentication and authorization, news feed, messaging, content creation and sharing, search, and notifications. Users can create profiles, customize their preferences, and connect with other users to form social networks.

The application is designed to be scalable and performant, with caching mechanisms and content delivery networks (CDNs) to ensure fast load times and low latency. The application also includes robust security features to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access, including multi-factor authentication and data encryption at rest and in transit.

The SRS document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the social media web application, including user stories, use cases, data models, and system architecture. The document serves as a guide for the development team, providing a clear understanding of the scope and expectations for the project.
